YOU MAY CHOOSE TO UPLOAD SOURCE CODE OR OTHER SOURCE FILES, BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED. 

This is for the actual source files, like C or C++ files and assets like sound, music and art. 
Do not include game engines or tools.
You can include your project folders from Unity or GameMaker.
You can write and include a README file that explains how to use your code to make the game.
For non-digital games, your PDF instructions would go here.
Test to make sure you have everything!
